## Description

In Thunder Fighter, you pilot a fighter jet battling waves of enemies in space. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move and the spacebar to shoot. As the game progresses, enemies become stronger and more numerous, with powerful Bosses appearing periodically. Defeat enemies and Bosses to score points and collect power-ups. **Complete all levels by defeating the final boss to achieve victory!**

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Pygame 2.6.0+
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mike861/thunder_fighter.git
   cd thunder_fighter
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   # venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Gameplay

### Controls

- **Movement**: Arrow Keys (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí) or WASD
- **Shoot**: Spacebar
- **Launch Missile**: X (when available)
- **Pause/Resume**: P
- **Toggle Music**: M
- **Toggle Sound Effects**: S
- **Adjust Volume**: +/- (Plus/Minus keys)
- **Switch Language**: L (Toggles between English and Chinese)
- **Quit Game**: ESC

### Game Objective

**Goal**: Progress through all 10 levels and defeat the final boss to achieve victory!

- **Early Levels (1-2)**: Advance by accumulating score points
- **Mid-to-Late Levels (3-10)**: Progress by defeating bosses at the end of each level
- **Final Victory**: Defeat the boss at Level 10 to complete the game
- **Victory Rewards**: Receive comprehensive statistics including final score, survival time, and completion achievements upon winning

### Visual Experience

Thunder Fighter features a **dynamic background system** with unique themes for each level:

- **Level 1 - Deep Space**: Peaceful blue/black starfield
- **Level 2 - Nebula Field**: Purple/blue nebula clouds  
- **Level 3 - Asteroid Belt**: Brown/orange asteroid field with animated debris
- **Level 4 - Red Zone**: Dangerous red space with particle storm effects
- **Level 5+ - Final Battle**: Ominous dark red atmosphere

Each level transition features smooth 3-second animations with no visual artifacts.

### Wingman System

Starting from game level 3, a new power-up item may appear. Collecting this item grants you a "wingman" fighter that flanks your ship.

- **Firepower**: Each wingman automatically fires tracking missiles at nearby enemies, prioritizing the Boss when active
- **Shields**: Wingmen act as shields, absorbing enemy fire. They will be destroyed after taking a certain amount of damage
- **Limits**: You can have a maximum of two wingmen at a time
- **Configuration**: The initial number of wingmen, maximum number, and formation spacing are all configurable in `thunder_fighter/constants.py`

## Configuration

Thunder Fighter uses a JSON-based configuration system:

```bash
# View and modify settings
python -m thunder_fighter.utils.config_tool show
python -m thunder_fighter.utils.config_tool set sound music_volume 0.8
python -m thunder_fighter.utils.config_tool reset
```

Settings are saved to `~/.thunder_fighter/config.json`. For detailed configuration options, see [Technical Details](docs/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md#configuration-options-reference).

## Architecture Overview

Thunder Fighter uses modern software engineering patterns:
- **Event-driven architecture** for decoupled components
- **Systems-based design** (collision, scoring, spawning, physics)
- **Factory pattern** for entity creation
- **State management** for game flow
- **Modular UI components** with single responsibility

See [Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation and [code organization](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#code-organization).

## Testing

The project includes 390+ comprehensive tests covering all aspects of the game:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v    # Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v          # Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v           # End-to-end tests
python -m pytest tests/systems/ -v       # Systems architecture tests
```

### Test Coverage
- **Core Systems**: Collision detection, scoring, spawning, physics
- **Game Mechanics**: Victory conditions, boss battles, level progression
