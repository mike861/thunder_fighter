## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame 2.0.0+
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mike861/thunder_fighter.git
   cd thunder_fighter
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   # venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Gameplay

### Controls

- **Movement**: Arrow Keys (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí) or WASD
- **Shoot**: Spacebar
- **Launch Missile**: X (when available)
- **Pause/Resume**: P
- **Toggle Music**: M
- **Toggle Sound Effects**: S
- **Adjust Volume**: +/- (Plus/Minus keys)
- **Switch Language**: L (Toggles between English and Chinese)
- **Quit Game**: ESC

### Game Objective

**Goal**: Progress through all 10 levels and defeat the final boss to achieve victory!

- **Early Levels (1-2)**: Advance by accumulating score points
- **Mid-to-Late Levels (3-10)**: Progress by defeating bosses at the end of each level
- **Final Victory**: Defeat the boss at Level 10 to complete the game
- **Victory Rewards**: Receive comprehensive statistics including final score, survival time, and completion achievements upon winning

### Visual Experience

Thunder Fighter features a **dynamic background system** with unique themes for each level:

- **Level 1 - Deep Space**: Peaceful blue/black starfield
- **Level 2 - Nebula Field**: Purple/blue nebula clouds  
- **Level 3 - Asteroid Belt**: Brown/orange asteroid field with animated debris
- **Level 4 - Red Zone**: Dangerous red space with particle storm effects
- **Level 5+ - Final Battle**: Ominous dark red atmosphere

Each level transition features smooth 3-second animations with no visual artifacts.

### Wingman System

Starting from game level 3, a new power-up item may appear. Collecting this item grants you a "wingman" fighter that flanks your ship.

- **Firepower**: Each wingman automatically fires tracking missiles at nearby enemies, prioritizing the Boss when active
- **Shields**: Wingmen act as shields, absorbing enemy fire. They will be destroyed after taking a certain amount of damage
- **Limits**: You can have a maximum of two wingmen at a time
- **Configuration**: The initial number of wingmen, maximum number, and formation spacing are all configurable in `thunder_fighter/constants.py`

## Configuration Management

Thunder Fighter includes a comprehensive configuration system that allows you to customize various aspects of the game.

### Configuration Tool

Use the built-in configuration tool to manage settings:

```bash
# Show current configuration
python -m thunder_fighter.utils.config_tool show

# Set music volume to 80%
python -m thunder_fighter.utils.config_tool set sound music_volume 0.8

# Enable developer mode
python -m thunder_fighter.utils.config_tool set debug dev_mode true

# Set difficulty to hard
python -m thunder_fighter.utils.config_tool set gameplay difficulty hard

# Reset all settings to defaults
python -m thunder_fighter.utils.config_tool reset
```

### Available Settings

| Section | Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Sound** | `music_volume` | Background music volume (0.0-1.0) | 0.5 |
| | `sound_volume` | Sound effects volume (0.0-1.0) | 0.7 |
| | `music_enabled` | Enable/disable music | true |
| | `sound_enabled` | Enable/disable sound effects | true |
| **Display** | `fullscreen` | Enable fullscreen mode | false |
| | `screen_scaling` | Screen scaling factor | 1.0 |
| **Gameplay** | `difficulty` | Game difficulty (easy/normal/hard) | normal |
| | `initial_lives` | Starting number of lives | 3 |
| **Debug** | `dev_mode` | Enable developer mode | false |
| | `log_level` | Logging level | INFO |

### Configuration File

Settings are automatically saved to `~/.thunder_fighter/config.json`. You can also edit this file directly if preferred.

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Adjust Log Level (Optional)
# Set the THUNDER_FIGHTER_LOG_LEVEL environment variable
# Windows
set THUNDER_FIGHTER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python main.py

# Linux/macOS
THUNDER_FIGHTER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python main.py
```

## Architecture Overview

Thunder Fighter uses modern software engineering patterns:
- **Event-driven architecture** for decoupled components
- **Systems-based design** (collision, scoring, spawning, physics)
- **Factory pattern** for entity creation
- **State management** for game flow
- **Modular UI components** with single responsibility

See [Architecture Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation.

## Testing

The project includes 375+ comprehensive tests covering all aspects of the game:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v    # Integration tests
