## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the following specifications:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add type hints for all function parameters and return values

### Code Formatting

We use Ruff for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code
ruff format .

# Check linting
ruff check .
```

### Documentation

- All functions and classes must have docstrings (Google style)
- Complex logic should have inline comments
- Update relevant documentation files for significant changes

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Tests should be in the appropriate directory under `tests/`
- Use pytest fixtures when appropriate

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements

### Examples

refactor(ui): separate health bar into its own component
```

## Pull Request Process

4. **Update documentation**: If applicable
5. **Create PR**: Use a clear, descriptive title
6. **Fill out template**: Complete the PR template
