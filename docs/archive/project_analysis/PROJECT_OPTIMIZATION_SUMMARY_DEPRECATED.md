├── state/                # State management tests
└── utils/                # Utility tests
```

### 2. Code Quality Improvements

**Duplicate File Elimination**:
- 4 sets of duplicate factory files
- 7 duplicate UI component files  
- 1 obsolete demo file with language violations
- 115 __pycache__ directories with 848 .pyc files

**Language Compliance**:
- Removed all Chinese comments and violations
- Enforced English-only code requirement
- Updated documentation standards

**Configuration Modernization**:
- Eliminated redundant pytest.ini
- Centralized configuration in pyproject.toml
- Updated .gitignore to Python best practices

### 3. Architecture Alignment

**Test-Code Alignment**:
```
