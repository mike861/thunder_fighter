## Core Design Principles

### Interface Quality First Principle

**Core Philosophy**: Thunder Fighter prioritizes clean, well-designed interfaces over backward compatibility. Interface quality takes precedence over maintaining legacy code patterns.

**Key Guidelines**:
- **Clean Interface Design**: Design intuitive and maintainable interfaces
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Eliminate poorly designed interfaces during refactoring
- **Dependency Injection**: Use optional parameters to support both testing and production environments

### Logic/Interface Separation Principle

**Architecture Pattern**: Separation of business logic from rendering concerns, enabling independent testing and cleaner component design.

**Core Components**:
1. **Pure Logic Classes**: Mathematical algorithms with minimal external dependencies
2. **Graphics Integration Layer**: Rendering components with dependency injection support
3. **Clean Factory Interfaces**: Required parameters eliminate ambiguous object creation

### Event-Driven Architecture
Game components communicate through `EventSystem` rather than direct coupling. All game events are defined in `events/game_events.py`.

#### Event System Architecture

**Core Components**:
- **EventSystem** - Central event dispatcher decoupling game components
- **GameEvent** - Factory methods for type-safe event creation
- **EventListener** - Observer pattern for event handling
- **Event Types** - Enumerated game events (PLAYER_DIED, BOSS_SPAWNED, etc.)

**Communication Flow**:
```
GameSystems → EventSystem → RegisteredListeners
```

For detailed class diagrams with method signatures, see [UML Class Diagrams](UML_CLASS_DIAGRAMS.md#event-system-class-diagram).

### Systems-Based Architecture
Core game logic is organized into dedicated systems in `systems/`:
- `CollisionSystem` - Unified collision detection and resolution for all entity interactions
- `ScoringSystem` - Centralized score management with level progression and achievement tracking
- `SpawningSystem` - Entity spawning coordination integrating all factory classes
- `PhysicsSystem` - Movement, boundaries, and collision detection for game physics

### Factory Pattern
Type-organized entity creation in `entities/` with clean interface design:
- `entities/enemies/` - `EnemyFactory` and `BossFactory` with difficulty scaling
- `entities/projectiles/` - `ProjectileFactory` with logic/interface separation
- `entities/items/` - `ItemFactory` for power-ups and collectibles
- `entities/player/` - Player and wingman entity management

### Single Responsibility
Each system has clear boundaries and focused responsibilities.

## System Architecture

### Input System Architecture

**Unified Input System**: Clean input architecture in `systems/input/`:
- `InputHandler` - Raw event processing with macOS screenshot interference handling
- `InputManager` - Event coordination and state management
- `InputFacade` - High-level input interface for game logic

The layered architecture provides:
- **Raw Event Processing**: Platform-specific event handling with fallback mechanisms
- **State Management**: Input state coordination and validation
- **Game Interface**: High-level input interface for game logic

### State Management System

**State Pattern**: Game states managed through `StateMachine` in `state/`:

#### Core Components
1. **GameState** - Data structure holding all game state information
2. **GameStateManager** - Centralized manager for state data and transitions
3. **StateMachine** - Generic state machine framework
4. **State** - Abstract base class for individual game states
5. **Concrete States** - Specific implementations for each game mode
6. **StateFactory** - Factory for creating state instances

#### State Types
- **MenuState** - Main menu (ready for future implementation)
- **PlayingState** - Active gameplay with enemy/boss/item spawning
- **PausedState** - Game paused with adjusted music volume
- **GameOverState** - Game over screen with restart/exit handling
- **VictoryState** - Victory screen with completion statistics
- **LevelTransitionState** - Level transition animations with 3-second timer

#### Key Features
- **Centralized State Management**: All game state in one place
- **Type-Safe State Transitions**: Clear, validated transitions
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: State change listeners and callbacks
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each state handles its own logic

#### State Management Architecture

**Core Pattern**: State machine framework managing game flow transitions.

**State Hierarchy**:
- **Abstract State** - Base state with lifecycle methods
- **Concrete States** - MenuState, PlayingState, PausedState, GameOverState, VictoryState, LevelTransitionState
- **StateMachine** - Manages transitions and event forwarding
- **StateFactory** - Creates state instances with game context

**State Flow**:
```
Menu → Playing → [Paused] → [LevelTransition] → GameOver/Victory
```

For detailed state class diagrams, see [UML Class Diagrams](UML_CLASS_DIAGRAMS.md#state-management-class-diagram).

### Background System Architecture

**Dynamic Background System**: Advanced visual enhancement with level-based themes.

**Core Features**:
- **Double Buffering**: Pre-rendering with smooth transitions
- **Level Progression**: Visual themes reflecting game difficulty
- **Performance Optimization**: Hardware-accelerated rendering

**Future Directions**:
1. **Component Entity System**: Potential migration to full ECS architecture
2. **Enhanced Modularity**: Further separation of concerns across system boundaries
3. **Interface Standardization**: Consistent design patterns across all factory classes
4. **Testing Integration**: Continued improvement of testable interface design
5. **Event System Expansion**: Apply event-driven patterns to other entity interactions

The Player system refactoring demonstrates successful application of Interface Quality First and Logic/Interface Separation principles, achieving substantial improvements in code quality and testability.
